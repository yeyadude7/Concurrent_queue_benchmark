# Simulation Module

Models a simplified server-side architecture to test queue performance under realistic workloads.

## Architecture

Clients (RequestGenerator)
↓
Ingress Queue (IQueue<Request>)
↓
WorkerPool → Workers (consume + process)


## Files
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| **Request.java** | Represents a synthetic server request with timing metadata. |
| **RequestGenerator.java** | Simulates client threads generating bursty traffic. |
| **Worker.java** | Consumes requests and performs synthetic work to simulate processing. |
| **WorkerPool.java** | Manages worker threads. |
| **ServerSimulator.java** | Coordinates clients, workers, and queues; reports throughput and latency. |

## Purpose
Connects micro-benchmarked data structures to a macro-level server simulation, enabling observation of how queue concurrency affects end-to-end system throughput.

## Example
```bash
javac -d ../../bin *.java
java -cp ../../bin simulation.ServerSimulator
